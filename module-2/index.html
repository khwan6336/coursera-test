        Red stands for many things, all of them potent. Red is romantic love,
        and its physical passion. Red is violence, anger, and aggression, and it
        frequently indicates danger. Paradoxically–for a color associated with
        action and energy–red is universally used as the color that means
        "stop." Red is used professionally to capture attention, elicit emotion,
        and convey confidence.

        <section >
        All the world over, yellow is associated with the sun and its life
        giving warmth. Yellow also stands for caution, and it’s used for traffic
        warning signs and traffic signals in nearly every country. Yellow is
        optimism and the cheerfulness of a sunny day. Bright yellow is an
        attention-getter, and its contrast with black is the most visible color
        combination.

        <section >
        While blue conjures images of sky and sea, it’s also the color of
        bravery and dedication. Blue represents introspective journeys and
        symbolizes wisdom and depth of understanding. But blue is also a symbol
        of depression and the depths of the human psyche. Blue stands for
        serenity, rather than passion, and it’s the color of all that’s constant
        and unchanging.
